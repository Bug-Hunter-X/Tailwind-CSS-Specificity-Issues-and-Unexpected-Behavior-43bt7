# Tailwind CSS Specificity Issues and Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in Tailwind CSS: unexpected behavior arising from specificity conflicts in complex layouts.  The problem is often not immediately apparent, leading to debugging challenges.

## Problem

When using Tailwind CSS in intricate UIs, applying styles correctly can become difficult when numerous classes are involved.  Specificity conflicts can occur, resulting in unintended styles overriding expected styles.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates several approaches to handle specificity issues:

1. **Using `!important` (Use Sparingly):**  This is a last resort, as overuse can harm maintainability.
2. **Utility-First Approach:** Sticking to a strict utility-first style helps in keeping the specificity manageable.
3. **Understanding CSS Specificity:** Having a strong grasp of CSS specificity rules allows for better predictability in how styles are applied.
